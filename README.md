# stereoDicChallange
 The version of the code used to analyze the submitted DIC data and
generate plots of stereo-DIC challenge 1.0. 

Order of running the files is as follows:

1- RegDICTransProfData_wa.m
2- paper_plottingMain.m (This will run two subsequent scripts in the end)

Note that the current version does not provide the data from other groups.
However, I intend to add the full scripts in near future to generate latex
tables and also provide decimated data from 5 other groups so that future
code development can be compared to the published results.
